## Version 1.0 - [2025-8-21]

### Added

- **Advanced Slideshow Controls:** Implemented frame-by-frame navigation and pause/resume functionality for still frame animations.
  - **ArrowUp Key:** Skip to next slideshow frame (pictures only, independent of audio)
  - **ArrowDown Key:** Pause/resume slideshow animation (pictures only, audio continues)
  - **Audio-Independent Operation:** Slideshow controls work completely independently of background audio and music playback
- **Enhanced Animation Functions:** Added `skipToNextFrame()` and `toggleAnimationPause()` functions to animation.js for granular slideshow control.
- **Narrative Text Positioning:** Added support for top, middle, and bottom positioning of narrative text with radio button selection in the builder interface.
- **Cross-Frame Communication:** Improved player-controls.js to properly communicate with iframe content for slideshow control.

### Changed

- **Keyboard Event Handling:** Updated generated page templates to include ArrowUp/ArrowDown event listeners for direct slideshow control.
- **Player Controls Architecture:** Enhanced player-controls.js fallback mechanism to call correct slideshow functions (`skipToNextFrame`, `toggleAnimationPause`) instead of non-existent functions.
- **Animation Control Separation:** Clearly separated full animation control (start/stop with audio) from slideshow control (frame navigation and pause/resume without audio).

### Fixed

- **ArrowUp/ArrowDown Not Working:** Resolved issue where keyboard shortcuts for slideshow control were not functioning due to missing event handlers in generated pages.
- **Cross-Origin Communication:** Improved iframe communication to properly handle slideshow controls when direct DOM access fails.
- **Function Name Mismatch:** Fixed player-controls.js to call the correct function names that actually exist in animation.js.

### Technical Improvements

- **Function Isolation:** Created dedicated functions for frame-by-frame control that don't interfere with existing play/stop animation functionality.

## Version 0.9 - [2025-8-16]

### Added

- **Express Server Integration:** Replaced static http-server with full Express.js server providing both file serving and backend script execution capabilities.
- **Functional Image Organization Button:** The "üîÑ ‰∏ÄÈîÆÊï¥ÁêÜÂõæÁâáÊñá‰ª∂Âêç" button now actually executes the `rename_slides_img.sh` script via server API calls, providing real automated image organization by creation date.
- **Automated Server Management:** Enhanced `start.sh` script now automatically installs dependencies, kills existing servers, and starts the Express server from the correct directory structure.
- **Server-Side Script Execution:** Added `/api/rename-images` endpoint that executes shell scripts server-side and returns results to the browser.

### Changed

- **File Structure Reorganization:** Moved all web assets into `pages/` directory and tools into `pages/tools/` for better organization and separation of concerns.
- **Server Architecture:** Migrated from static file server to Express.js with proper backend capabilities for script execution.
- **Startup Process:** `start.sh` now serves from parent directory to properly handle multiple story projects under the `stories/` structure.
- **Button Functionality:** Converted previously informational "image organization" button into fully functional feature with real-time execution and feedback.

### Fixed

- **Path Resolution Issues:** Corrected all file paths to work with the new directory structure and server setup.
- **Script Execution Context:** Fixed working directory issues in `rename_slides_img.sh` execution to ensure proper media folder detection.
- **Server Persistence:** Added automatic process cleanup to prevent multiple server instances and port conflicts.

### Technical Improvements

- **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation:** Left and right arrow keys now trigger autoplay functionality in addition to page navigation, ensuring seamless hands-free operation.

### Changed

- **Improved Autoplay Reliability:** The autoPlayCurrentPage() function now includes a 500ms delayed AppleScript fallback to handle cases where browser autoplay policies prevent media from starting automatically.

## Version 0.7 - [2025-5-30]


-   **Auto-incrementing Media Paths:** When saving a page, file paths in the following fields that match the pattern `media/{current-page-number}.{extension}` or `media/{current-page-number}/` are automatically updated to `media/{new-page-number}.{extension}` or `media/{new-page-number}/`. This feature applies to:
    -   ÂêéÊôØ (Background) URL
    -   ÂâçÊôØ (Foreground) URL
    -   Â£∞Èü≥ (Audio) URL
    -   ÂπªÁÅØÁâáËøûÊí≠ (Animation) ÂõæÁâáÊñá‰ª∂Â§πË∑ØÂæÑ
    -   ÂπªÁÅØÁâáÈü≥È¢ë (Animation Audio)

### Changed

-   **Separate Player Settings Management:** The Êí≠ÊîæÂô®ËÆæÁΩÆ (Player Settings) now have dedicated "Âä†ËΩΩÊí≠ÊîæÂô®ËÆæÁΩÆ" (Load Player Settings) and "‰øùÂ≠òÊí≠ÊîæÂô®ËÆæÁΩÆ" (Save Player Settings) buttons within their section. This clearly separates player configuration from individual page settings, preventing confusion previously caused by using page 0 for this purpose.
    -   "Âä†ËΩΩÊí≠ÊîæÂô®ËÆæÁΩÆ" now reads the existing `player.html` file to populate the Player Settings form fields.
    -   "‰øùÂ≠òÊí≠ÊîæÂô®ËÆæÁΩÆ" saves the current form values and generates the `player.html` file.

### Fixed

-   **ÊïÖ‰∫ãÂú∫ÊôØËÉåÊôØËâ≤ (Scene Background Color) Application:** The ÊïÖ‰∫ãÂú∫ÊôØËÉåÊôØËâ≤ now correctly affects the background of individual saved pages. This was resolved by:
    -   Ensuring the `sceneBgColor` is applied inline to the `<body>` tag of each saved `pageN.html` file.
    -   Removing a conflicting `background: black;` rule from the `body` selector in `builder.css` that was previously overriding the inline styles.
